# SP23-Virtual-Reality-Training-And-Effects-On-Learning-Retention
Since the advent of VR technology, people have seen great potential in immersing people in a virtual environment. One
of the biggest potentials here is in learning. Whether it is training neurosurgeons, mechanics, architects, or engineers,
VR has been seen as a way to enhance training. [1 ] [ 3 ] But with such a rush towards this medium of learning, we
wanted to know how well spatial information can be learned/retained in VR versus real world training. This is important
because VR might actually negatively affect a personâ€™s ability to learn and retain spatial information
